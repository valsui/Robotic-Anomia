# Robotic Anomia

## Robotic Anomia is a project aiming to use machine learning to analyze text in images, and then simulate what functionality the AI would lose when certain capabilities are taken away. 

## Background and Overview

Using machine learning to analyze images is a common challenge in modern computer science. We intend to explore the ideas of machine learning by creating an AI with a neural network that can analyze user written text and and interpret it as a string. Once the model is functioning, we intend to take out core components in the pipeline in order to represent certain diseases of the brain.  

## Functionality & MVP
[ ]  Allow users to draw letter on a canvas for the AI to interpret
[ ]  Build a neural network and train it with set data (forward and backwards propagation) for it to recognize user inputted canvas
[ ] Generate reliable weights using the training process
[ ] Allow users to test trained weights on website by using canvas
[ ] Remove functionality of neural layer to allow user to visualize how certain pipelines in the neural network operate

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
Frontend: React/ Redux JavaScript 
Libraries: TensorFlow.js, D3.js

### Composing a dataset

We will create a pre-trained data set that defines what images correspond to each letter of the alphabet. We will then train the network with “training” data of additional images that correspond to each letter to expand the network’s abilities. Users will interact with pre-trained data via our website and explore information relating to each of the components, including what disabling a component will cause our model output
